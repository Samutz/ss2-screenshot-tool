# About
This is a tool I developed to automate the process of taking screenshots of Sim Settlements 2 addon items.

# <span style="color:red">WARNING</span>
This tool is not meant to be used by casual players or in a casual playthough. It should only be used in a development environment by people that know what they are doing. This tool modifies some of SS2's sytems and has the potential to corrupt save files.

For these reasons, I do not permit this tool to be uploaded to any other website, including NexusMods or Bethesda.net.
